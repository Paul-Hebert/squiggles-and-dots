It snowed for the first time this season in Portland. After tromping down to the Montavilla Farmers Market with my dog Clover to meet my girlfriend and buy groceries, I sat down by the living room window with a hot mug of coffee and coded some snow flakes.

Recently the term "snow flake" has been used as an insult. I don't understand how you could hate a snow flake. They're beautiful, unique, fragile, and temporary, just like people. Every time it snows I feel like a kid again. Here's my attempt at celebrating the beauty of snow flakes.

I probably could have gotten more consistently nice snowflakes by adding a few more rules to my code, but I like how random these are now.

More structure might ruin the beauty.
